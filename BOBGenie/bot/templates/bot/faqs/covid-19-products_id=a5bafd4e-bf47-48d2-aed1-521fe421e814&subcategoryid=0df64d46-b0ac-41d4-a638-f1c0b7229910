<h6>Note on Financial Parameters
<h6></h6>
<p>Some of the key ratios have been marked as not applicable in the case of certain sectors in line with the recommendations of the Expert Committee which has concluded that those ratios may not be relevant for the respective sectors to which they have been made as not applicable.
</p>
<p>*No threshold has been prescribed for Current Ratio due to the “just in time inventory” business model for raw materials and parts, and finished goods inventory is funded by channel financing available from the dealers.</p>

<p>**DSCR thresholds have not been prescribed since most of the airline companies work on refinancing of debt as a financing strategy. Consequently, average DSCR threshold is also not prescribed.</p>
<p>##In the roads sector, the financing is cash flow based and at SPV level where the level of debt is decided at the time of initial project appraisal. The working capital cycle in this sector is also negative. Accordingly, ratios like TOL / ATNW, Debt/EBITDA and Current ratio may not be relevant at the time of restructuring in this sector.</p>
<p>@Most of the companies in the sector do not use long term debt for funding their operations and are unlisted. Hence DSCR and average DSCR may not be relevant for the sector.</p>

<li>As advised by the RBI, the Moratorium, first granted for payments falling due between 1st March 2020 and 31st May 2020 has now been extended to payments falling due till 31st August 2020</li>
<li>The Moratorium is applicable for your BoB Credit Card dues as indicated in the statements dated 1st June 2020, 1st July 2020 and 1st August 2020
</li>
<li>You are eligible for the Moratorium if your statement dated 1st March 2020 did NOT mention “IMMEDIATE” under the “Payment Due Date” column.</li>
<li>If your 1st March 2020 statement mentioned “IMMEDIATE” under Payment Due Date, please make the payment as advised on the statement or on call from our representatives, to make your BoB credit card account regular. Once your card account is regular and your statements of 1st June, 1st July and 1st August do not mention “IMMEDIATE”, you will be eligible for the remaining Moratorium period.
</li>
<li>If you are eligible for the Moratorium, you may choose not to make any payment towards the dues indicated in the 1st June, 1st July and 1st August statements. No Late Payment Charges will be levied as part of the Moratorium. Your card account will continue to be regular and will not be reported as overdue/delinquent during the Moratorium period.
</li>

<li>However, as advised by the RBI, interest will continue to occur on the unpaid balance and fresh transactions, unless you pay the Total Payment Due. We recommend you continue to make payments to avoid/reduce accrual of interest.

</li>
<li>Please note that any payments already made towards your 1st June statement dues will not be refunded.</li>

<li>If you have opted for Auto Debit, we will debit your BoB savings account towards the payments due in the 1st June, 1st July and 1st August statements. If you do not want us to debit your BoB savings account during the Moratorium extension, please respond to the SMS and E-mail you’ll receive from us shortly.
</li>
<li>As per current guidelines, the Moratorium will end on 31st August 2020. Hence, the statement dated 1st September 2020 will require you to pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date, to avoid levy of Late Payment Charges and your credit card becoming overdue/delinquent. The statement will also have the interest accrued during the Moratorium period, and will be part of payment due.
</li>
<li>For more questions about the Moratorium, please visit our website (www.bobfinancial.com) and check the FAQ. You can also check the Most Important Terms & Conditions to understand how interest is charged on the unpaid balances and fresh transactions, if you don’t pay the Total Payment Due.

<p>However, if the person has recently visited a country which is affected by the pandemic of COVID-19, he/she needs to get himself/herself tested/ medically screened and obtain a fitness certificate before going outside to public places including bank branch</p>

<p>The same protocol is required to be followed if residing with a family member falling under any of the above categories.</p>

<p>We have advised our staff members also to follow the same protocol.

<p>For EMI based Term Loans, it will be three EMIs falling due between 1st March 2020 and May 31st, 2020 and the tenor will be extended by three months and have to be repaid during the extended period.

<p>For other Term Loans, it will be all the instalments and Interest falling due during the same period, irrespective of the tenor of payment i.e. Monthly, Quarterly, Half Yearly, Annually, Bullet Payment etc. For Term Loans, where the repayment has not commenced, the interest portion for three months alone needs to be reckoned.

For business loans of Rs. 5 Crores and above, the Banks report the overdue position to RBI also through CRILC. As a result of this relief package, the overdue payments post 1st March 2020 will not be reported to Credit Bureaus/ CRILC for three months. No penal interest or charges will be payable to the Banks. Similarly, SEBI has allowed that Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) may not consider the delay as default by listed companies if the same is owing to lockdown conditions arising due to Covid-19.

However, you must take into account that the EMI of the loans, though not mandatorily payable immediately and gets postponed by 3 months, continues to accrue interest on compounding basis in your account which results as higher amount and additional EMIs. It is advised, if someone has adequate cashflows and capacity to pay regular EMIs, he/she should continue to pay.
